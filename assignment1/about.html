      <h1>About Me</h1>
      My name is Bolaji Issa, I'm an undergraduate student of Tai Solarin
      University Of Education, and I'm studying Library and Information Science.
      I hail from Kwara state, but I'm currently living in Lagos state. My
      purpose for enrolling into Altschool Africa is to acquire the necessary
      skills that can make me a world class frontend engineer, and I'd also like
      to meet new people and make meaningful connection along the path of
      becoming a world class engineer.
